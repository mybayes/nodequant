##NodeQuant's Vision

Enable the Node.js community to easily develop and deploy quantitative financial trading programs, becoming a simple, efficient, and reliable quantitative trading platform

##Introduction to NodeQuant

Most domestic quantitative trading platforms use languages such as C, C++, C #, Java, Python, etc. to write quantitative strategies. Personnel engaged in quantitative trading should not only learn financial data analysis, but also master a programming language. Often, mastering a programming language is a significant barrier for many people. JavaScript language is a simple and lightweight scripting language, making learning and writing JavaScript programs very easy. Script languages have the characteristic of weak typing, which does not require developers to adapt to various data types during the programming process, making it easy to get started.
JavaScript has a large number of developers and is the most popular programming language on GitHub. The JavaScript language, with the help of the Node.js runtime environment, can run on the server-side like high-level languages such as C++and C #, allowing for operations such as reading and writing files, databases, and accessing networks.

###Github's Top 10 Most Popular Languages

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment based on Chrome V8 engine.

Node.js uses an event driven, non blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.

Npm, the package manager for Node.js, is the world's largest open-source library ecosystem. Using npm, various third-party libraries can be found that developers can integrate into their own programs.

Quantitative financial trading program is a data intensive program based on high-frequency network access and various events (OnTick, OnOrder, OnTrade). Due to its non blocking and event driven I/O operations, Node.js is very lightweight and efficient in handling data intensive real-time applications, making it a perfect solution for real-time application systems in data intensive distributed deployment environments.

Using Node.js to write and run quantitative trading strategy programs is a great solution.

This is the background of the birth of NodeQuant's quantitative financial trading platform.
